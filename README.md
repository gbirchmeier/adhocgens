# adhocgens
Ad hoc codegens that I write for various projects.

I keep them around because they are useful to refer to, especially if I'm writing a new one.

They're written in Ruby, because that's what I'm fast at.  But they could be generating any language.

They are probably not documented, or intended for re-use.

Feel free to look.
